A simple adventure game by Sehadatullah Atal based on a simple adventure game engine by [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly).

Castle Destroyer
Destroy the castle and make the enemy fall.


Controls:
Use the mouse and click and drag the rock sling to through a rock towards the castle.
Space bar will spawn in a new rock.

Asset sources:
I downloaded some assets such as the rocks and blocks but created the enemy sprite myself on photoshop.
I also used the Matter.js library for the physics.

Code sources:
- `Matter.js`
- `castleblock.js`, `catapult.js`, `enemy.js`, `ground.js`, `index.html`, `main.js`, `player.js`, was written by me.
Videos from SimonDev on youtube helped in the visualization and Matter.js tutorial use.
